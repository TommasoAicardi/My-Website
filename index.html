			<h2>Research Interests</h2>
			<p>I am currently interested in understanding how living with a frail family member
			shapes the health and life trajectories of other household members. More broadly,
			I would like to explore themes at the intersection of health demography, family
			sociology, and social stratification, ideally through computational approaches
			or a life-course perspective.</p>
